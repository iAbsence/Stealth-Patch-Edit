# Stealth Patch Edit
More legit edit to the stealth patch.

## Differences:
- Setup weights changed
- Some firerim occurances with original removed
- Stealth trade rounds edited

## Future Update Plans
- Weighted dogs to favor more 4s over 5s, same with monkeys
- Drop cycle arrays that are "randomized" but are in the players favor

## How to install
First you need to install the stealth patch files which can be found here as well as the tutorial to install: [StealthPatch](https://github.com/BlackOps115/StealthPatch)

Next once you've downloaded the edit, take the override file of the respective you want to stealth and add it into your zone folder found at: Call of Duty Black Ops\zone\Common

Before launching the game you'd want to add the respective keybinds to your config which can be found at [StealthPatch](https://github.com/BlackOps115/StealthPatch) as well.
The respective keybinds are found under the associated map. You can copy/paste them from there.

Once you have everything setup, simply run the game from the bat file or shortcut you installed/created from the [StealthPatch](https://github.com/BlackOps115/StealthPatch) tutorial and enjoy cheating

Enjoy cheating losers, just remember you still have to be good at the game to get a record so if you do not fit that box then this will not help you. Also remember, if you don't have any bad trades at all your game will be obvious. Be sure to throw in a handful of 100+ trades or even 40-70 hits. Remeber these games are avg 70-80 hours, no one is that lucky, make it look real. Last thing, for anyone thinking these stealth patches are undetectable, they are detectable. They just aren't to 90% of the high rounders in the zombies community. There is always a way to tell. If you get caught or pull an Unpulverized situation, that is entirely on YOU. Just get better at the game.
